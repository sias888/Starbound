TopDown Shooter Source Files

A small 2D Pixel Art bullet-hell style action shooter I developed in my spare time. The objective is to beat the level without losing all your health, kill the boss, and get as high a score as possible!


[WASD] to move

[L SHIFT] to shoot

[ENTER] to dodge

['] to melee

[;] to heal

dodge while healing to "break" enemy bullets.

Destroy enemies to increase your score. A high score multiplier multiplies your damage, but taking damage decreases the mutiplier. Use a melee attack to build energy, which you can spend to dodge or heal your missing HP. You can spend all your energy to destroy all enemy bullets for a few seconds of relief.


You can also use a xbox/playtation controller, in which case the controls are as follows:

Left analog stick to move.

Right trigger to shoot.

East face button to dodge.

West face button to melee.

North face button to heal.
